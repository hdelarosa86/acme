###### THINGS I WOULD DO IN THE FUTURE
1. I would create more test. With more time I would like to test my React Components and do more unit testing.
2. In a larger app I would have used a state management library like Redux, in order to seperate concerns, avoid side effects with asynchronous calls and keep my components cleaner and more readable.
3. I would also add front end validation so the user can get feedback while navigating the app.
4. On the same note, I would also add error logging in the server to keep track of errors during development and do a better job at sending errors to the user using the server.
5. I would also add better styling by using a component library to make the design look clean and modern.
